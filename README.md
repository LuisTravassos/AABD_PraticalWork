Practical Work in Database Architecture and Administration

This repository contains the practical work of the course in Database Architecture and Administration, which is part of the Computer Engineering degree, Information Systems branch, at the Superior Institute of Engineering of Coimbra.
Objectives

The aim of this assignment is to provide students with the opportunity to design and implement a relational database using the Oracle Database Management System (DBMS). This project aims to apply the knowledge acquired throughout the classes, stimulating research capabilities and independent work.

While the assignment describes a complete system in a client/server architecture, the focus for students will be on implementing the server component. User interface implementation is not required for this assignment.
Evaluation

The assessment of this work will be based on criteria such as readability, completeness, and efficiency of the proposed solutions. These aspects will carry significant weight in the final evaluation.
Description of the System to Implement

The system to be implemented encompasses a relational database using the Oracle DBMS. Although the assignment describes a complete system in a client/server architecture, students will focus on implementing the server component.
Submission of Elements

The following elements should be produced and submitted as part of the assignment:

    Source Code: The project's source code, organized in a clear and commented manner.
    Documentation: Any additional documentation necessary to understand and execute the project.
    Execution Instructions: Clear instructions on how to run the project, including environment setup and Oracle DBMS initialization.
